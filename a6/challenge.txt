Challenge Question

For the challenge question, I added a "next block" preview above the play area.

Logically, the main thing I needed to change was to make the game have a "current"
block and a "next" block. Whenever a block is placed and a new block is needed, 
the "next" block becomes the "current" block, and the "next" block is set with a 
new random block.

Also the cheat function will override whatever the next block is, so you will 
see it in the preview.

Graphically, I needed to increase the size of the window to add new GUI elements. 
A simple hack I did was to override the TetrisRoot class in the graphics interface. 
I probably should have just used TK directly instead, but this seemed to work well 
and did not affect the original game or the enhanced game.

I reused the TetrisCanvas class to make a new small canvas above the main canvas 
in which I draw the next block.

To run using 'ruby hw6runner.rb challenge', I added to 'hw6runner.rb' a new
method 'runMyTetrisChallenge' that will call 'MyTetrisChallenge.new' and then 
'mainLoop'. Also in the 'if' statement, I addend a new clause for "challenge" 
that calls this method. I think this is how the assignment requested I do it. 
Code is below if not.










# hw6runner.rb


require_relative './hw6provided'
require_relative './hw6assignment'

def runTetris
  Tetris.new 
  mainLoop
end

def runMyTetris
  MyTetris.new
  mainLoop
end

def runMyTetrisChallenge
  MyTetrisChallenge.new
  mainLoop
end

if ARGV.count == 0
  runMyTetris
elsif ARGV.count != 1
  puts "usage: hw6runner.rb [enhanced | original | challenge]"
elsif ARGV[0] == "enhanced"
  runMyTetris
elsif ARGV[0] == "original"
  runTetris
elsif ARGV[0] == "challenge"
  runMyTetrisChallenge
else
  puts "usage: hw6runner.rb [enhanced | original | challenge]"
end
