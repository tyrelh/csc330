# CSC 330 Programming Languages
## Standard ML (Unit 1)
Standard ML is a statically typed functional language similar to Haskell.

Assignments 1 through 3 as well as part of 7 are done in Standard ML.

Topics covered include:
* Functional programming style. Separation of concerns and composing functions together for more complicated tasks.
* SML syntax
  * `val` and `fun` keywords
  * `if then else`
  * `=` equality
  * `::` cons operator
  * `@` list concatenation
  * `case` keyword
* Pattern matching
* Higher order functions
  * `filter`, `map`, and `fold`
* Tail recursion
* Functions as first class citizens
* Data types
* Type checking
* Currying
## Racket (Unit 2)
Racket is a dynamically typed functional language similar to Lisp.

Assignments 4 and 5 are done in Racket.

Topics covered include:
* Racket syntax
  * `let`, `let*`, and `letrec` scope
  * `pair` pairs and lists
  * `car` and `cdr` for head and tail
  * `cons` list concatenation
  * `set!` mutability
* Thunks and Promises
* Streams
* Macros
* Structs

## Ruby (Unit 3)
Ruby is a dynamically typed object-oriented language that uses paradims from many other languages.

Assignments 6 and 7 are done in Ruby.

Topics covered include:
* Ruby syntax
  * `@` and `@@` for object field scope
  * `class`
  * `<` class inheritance
  * `self`
  * Blocks and `yeild`
* Inheritance
* Objects and classes
* Dynamic dispatch
* Overloading
* Duck typing
